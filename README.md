# Hospital-Patient-Queue
The Hospital Patient Queue project in Python demonstrates how patients wait in line at a hospital and how they are being served by a doctor in the order they arrive. The project also uses a Queue Data Structure (FIFO - First In, First Out) to handle the patients flowing through the hospital as in real life
Product Description
Patient Registeration: New patients can be place on the end of the queue.


Next Patient: Doctor or nurse may call the next patient from the front of the queue.


Queue Status: You can print or see a list of patients on the queue any time as you wish.


Fairness: The system handles all patients in the proper sequence so no one is unfairly handled.


Getting Started
Saving the file: Save the above Python code as hospital_patient_queue.py.


Open your terminal: Change directory to the directory where you saved the file.


Run the file: By using Python interpreter, run the file using this command:
